# img-mosaik

Generates a big mosaik picture from many sub pictures.  
For example:  
![]()  
  
  
The script:  
* Renames big amount of sub pictures
* Resizes big amount of sub pictures
* Calculates an average color for each sub picture
* And does the merging
(All of these functionalities are thrown into one file - not a pretty solution, but most of the time it works)  
  
The script expects sub pictures to be in a folder named *pics*.  
  
  
It is not quick. With a set of  around 600 subpics it takes 2-3 hours to finish the merging.
